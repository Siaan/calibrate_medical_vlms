# On Calibration of Modern Medical Vision-Language Models

## Approach

![alt text](./figs/zero_shot_acc_vs_ece2.png)

An extensive empirical investigation across different models, datasets, and prompting
strategies showed that medical vision-language models tend to be largely unreliable out-of-the-box in the zero-shot setting.

## Setup

Requires python >= 3.10, [https://pypi.org/project/uncertainty-calibration/](uncertainty calibration) library, and [https://pypi.org/project/open-clip-torch/](OpenAi's CLIP) library.
